        <h3>Intention</h3>
        <p>
            Neuronizer is the swap partition for your brain. This means it is here to store all the
            information you would forget otherwise. It offers the opportunity to order your thoughts
            in categories to recognize the information you need as fast as possible. Whenever you
            need more flexibility you can order your content just the way you like.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Your data is yours. Everything you save to Neuronizer is stored locally on your device only!
            The developers are not responsible for any kind of data loss. If you want to migrate your
            data to a new phone, use Import/Export from the settings.
        </p>
        <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
        <p>
            Special thanks goes to all the Todolist Of Death users, who gave me a lot of feedback. It
            helped me create this improved version of the app. Furthermore I would like to thank all
            the people who participated in the beta phase to test and improve Neuronizer.
